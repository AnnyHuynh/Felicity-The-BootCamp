## Project Description
* Our intent for this project is to create something that the class can use in the future. * Our incentive - our project is centered around innovation. Up until we were assigned study groups people were so reluctant to join study groups When the users sign up they can answer questions - prior experiences - where youre located - what part of coding you're interested in - whats your sign - what languages do you speak 

## Project Requirements 

* Must use a Node and Express Web Server - user should be able to input something and see it display (get and post)
* Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
* Must be deployed using Heroku (with data) - 
* Must utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven't discussed -  npm package
* Must have published frontend / UI - at first we keep our front end pretty simple - keep it simple 
* Must have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm - keeping organized - sticking to format
* Must meet good quality ccoding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
* Must protect API keys in node with environment variables
* ((((put "es lint rc" in the repo so code stays consistent))))
